Going into the project I was feeling really confident. I had an idea on how I was going to tackle this project and how I wanted it to turn out to be.
I struggled to find a good starting point, so I relied on the videos that were presented to us to create Pong and Mario and go based off that.
I realized that much of this code was useless to me and was making it difficult to actually get it to come out the way I intended it for.
I was struggling and having a hard time trying to figure out what to do next. Then once Thanksgiving rolled around, I felt somewhat depressed after 
remembering how my grandfather had passed away a few months ago from COVID and I wasn't able to see him again around this time. I really did not know what to do
and that only caused me to give up even more on this project. Then, to add more stress on top of that, the tires on my car had been stolen and I had to get all 
that figured out with insurance and police and that just wasted more time and took my mind off the project. At this point, I felt like there was no use in doing
this project anymore because I just didn't know what else to do. Then I decided to go on Youtube to find at least some help and to my luck, I found a Youtuber 
that uploaded videos on how to create a platform video game on Lua and I just went off on his code and was able to get something out of it. I included the link 
on his channel here: https://youtu.be/9jZiA24kM6A. All credit goes to him because I was able to get something out with his code.
