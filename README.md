# CIS1051_final_project
# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Remixing one of my favorite games called MegaMan X, the introductory level. 
I was also thinking about building a website, but wasn't too sure what to put on that. I know I will have to be working with Java, CSS and HTML. I've had previous experience with CSS and HTML, but that was a few years ago, so I will have to refresh on those skills. 
Another idea I had in mind was to create an app, but haven't really gotten far with what kind of app and what it will do. 

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

As of for now, I'm working by myself, unless I do find 1 or 2 other people to collaborate with. I want to work with other people, but I feel like we won't come to a solid agreement about what we want to make. 

## Do you have any questions of your own?

As of for now, I don't really have any other questions, just my only concern would be if I'm able to finish the assignemnt in time and if I don't, would what I have up to the deadline, be enough. 
But everything we do would be made in lua/love? correct? Or does that only pertain to making games?
Thats all.
